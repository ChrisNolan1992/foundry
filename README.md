# foundry [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/foundry.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/foundry)

Release manager for [npm][], [bower][], [component][], [PyPI][], [git tags][], and any plugin you can write.

[npm]: http://npmjs.org/
[bower]: http://bower.io/
[component]: http://component.io/
[PyPI]: http://pypi.python.org/
[git tags]: http://git-scm.com/

This was created out of frustration; there was no generic release manager. Previous to this, I was using [git-extra's git-release][] command with [dotfiles git hooks][].

[git-extra's git-release]: https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras/blob/1.9.0/Readme.md#git-release
[dotfiles git hooks]: https://github.com/twolfson/dotfiles/tree/0.39.1/git-template-dir/hooks

// TODO: Example output (probably via screenshot)

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install foundry`

```javascript
var foundry = require('foundry');
foundry.awesome(); // "awesome"
```
